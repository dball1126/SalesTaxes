# How To Run
Assuming you have Java installed, preferably JDK 8. You can do two things:
- Go into the folder and compile it via the command `javac Basket.java`.
- Run the file using `java Basket.java`.
- If you want to load a file yourself place it into the folder, compile it via the command up top,
  and run this command: `java Basket data1.txt`  (replace data1.txt with your filename).
